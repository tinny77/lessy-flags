## Sassy Flags

#### Introduction
Sassy Flags is a lightweight Sass libary you can use to display flags on your site. It's super simple but let me go over how to use it below.

#### How to use
To use Sassy Flags just add an element to your exsiting code, then give it the class of `'flag'`. Now you can look in the `sassy-flags.scss` document and find the country code of the flag you want, heres an example for the UK flag:
```
<span class="flag gb"></span>
```

#### Thanks
I will add more flags over time, if there are any you really want then let me know on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/_dthms).
