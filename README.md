## Lessy Flags

#### Introduction
Less version of Sassy Flags, a lightweight Sass libary created by Daniel Thomas you can use to display flags on your site. It's super simple but let me go over how to use it below.

#### How to use
To use Lessy Flags just add an element to your exsiting code, then give it the class of `'flag'`. Now you can look in the `lessy-flags.less` document and find the country code of the flag you want, heres an example for the UK flag:
```
<span class="flag gb"></span>
```

#### Support
